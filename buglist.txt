Bug:
	isEmpty always returns true

	Note:
		This would cause test 9 to fail
Bug:
	After visualizing what happens to the list after an addBack call by converting the list to a vector it is then easy
	to see that the addBack function is actually adding whatever is passed to the front of the list. The addBack function
	is essentially an addFront function.

	Note:
		This bug would cause test 3 to pass since it is only checking for size but it would fail test 7 since it is
		checking for exact values.

Bug:
	After visualizing the linked list after calling both remove functions it appears they don't make any changes to the
	list. My best quess why this could be happening is that the remove functions are based off of the isEmpty function.
	The remove functions may only be removing a node from the list if isEmpty returns false but since it never does then
	the remve functions would make no changes

	Note:
		This would cause test 4 and 5 to fail since the size is not changing after the remove functions are called.
