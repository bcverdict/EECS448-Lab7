Bug:
	After visualizing what happens to the list after an addBack call by converting the list to a vector it is then easy
	to see that the addBack function is actually adding whatever is passed to the front of the list. The addBack function
	is essentially an addFront function.

	Note:
		This bug would cause test 3 to pass since it is only checking for size but it would fail test 7 since it is
		checking for exact values.

Bug:
	After visualizing the linked list after calling both remove functions it appears they don't make any changes to the
	list.

	Note:
		This would cause test 4 and 5 to fail since the size is not changing after the remove functions are called.
